Three-Key Unique Code Input Method (IME)

Description:
TriKeySndMem IME (Three-Key Sound-Memory Input Method) is an efficient, non-redundant input system designed for Traditional Chinese (zh-tw) typing. This method utilizes three components to uniquely encode characters:

Semantic Code: Based on an intuitive memory concept using mnemonic keywords.
Supplementary Code: A third key ensures uniqueness, even among similar characters.
Features:
Fast Typing: Optimized for minimal keystrokes per character.
Low Collision: Ensures unique codes for each character using a supplementary code.
Traditional Chinese Focus: Supports commonly used Big5 and Unicode characters.
